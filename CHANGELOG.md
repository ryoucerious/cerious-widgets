# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Added
- Support for Angular **standalone components** â€” the grid can now be used without importing a shared module.
- Integrated **Angular Signals** for improved reactive performance in change detection and data binding.

### Changed
- Updated internal structure to reduce module dependencies and improve compatibility with future Angular versions.

### Notes
- This version maintains backward compatibility with non-standalone usage.
- Consumers can now use the grid directly in `standalone: true` components with `importProvidersFrom()` or custom providers.
