- Cerious Grid\n(Pronounced: Serious)\nA seriously powerful Angular grid — for developers who demand control, flexibility, and performance.Part of the Cerious Widgets collection.\n\n🚀 Why Cerious Grid?\nCerious Grid isn't just a table — it's a full-blown, enterprise-grade Angular grid built for speed, extensibility, and total customization.\nWith a modern plugin system, rich templating support, and no heavy dependencies, it's everything you need to build real-world data-intensive apps.\n\n✨ Features\n⚡️ Core UX & Performance\n\n🔁 Virtual Scrolling — Render thousands of rows without performance hits  \n🔄 Pagination  \n🌐 Server-Side Mode — Pagination, Filtering, Virtual Scroll\n\n🧭 Layout & Interaction\n\n↕️ Column Resizing and Pinning  \n🔗 Drag-and-Drop Columns  \n🧱 Grouped Column Headers  \n📊 Group By — with drag-to-group UI  \n🧬 Nested Rows — Use any Angular template for children (tables, charts, etc.)\n\n🔍 Data Interaction\n\n🧠 Multi-Column Sorting — Ctrl/Meta click to multi-sort  \n🧹 Column Filtering — Text, number, select, date\n\n🧾 Customization\n\n🧾 Custom Templates — Cells, headers, rows — fully yours  \n💡 Directive-Based Plugin Templates\n\n🧩 Extensibility & Persistence\n\n🧩 Pluggable Architecture — Add or override behavior without touching core  \n💾 Save & Restore Views — Favorites, state, layout\n\n📤 Output & Licensing\n\n📦 Excel Export — One-liner export with xlsx  \n🔓 MIT Licensed and Fully Open Source\n\n\n📦 Installation\nExample :npm install ngx-cerious-widgets xlsx\n🧪 Quick Start\nExample :\n\n🧩 Plugin Example\nExample :export class MyPlugin implements GridPlugin {\n  onInit(api: GridApi) {\n    api.onCellClick.subscribe(cell => {\n      console.log('Cell clicked:', cell);\n    });\n  }\n}You can also consume templates using Angular @Directive()s to inject content dynamically.\n\n📸 Live Demos\nComing soon — StackBlitz playground and hosted demo app\n\n🤝 Contributing\nWe welcome your ideas, plugins, and PRs.Head to the issues page to suggest features or report bugs.\n\n📝 License\nMIT — free for personal and commercial projects.\n\n🧠 Built With Purpose\nCerious Grid was built by a developer who’s spent nearly two decades in enterprise front-end development.If you’ve ever been frustrated by AG Grid’s licensing or boxed in by rigid tables — this is for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
